 * Accept a literal double quote by re-parsing the whole line, not by heuristic.
 *
 * A double quote is both the operand delimiter and an ordinary character to append, insert or substitute. '$"' is unambiguous to a reader and, to read_operand, an operand that opens and never closes. 138 of the 17,320 catalog rules are exactly that shape -- $" ^" @" e" i0"..i9" o0"..o9" and 62 substitutions -- and every one was refused. That was the whole of the divergence from the byte engine: no rule without a quote differed.
 *
 * The line survives packing, so the resolution is to ask the parser twice rather than to guess from quote counts: once with quoted operands enabled and, only if that returns RULE32_ERR_INVALID, once with quotes as plain characters. RULE32_ERR_NOROOM is never retried, since that means the caller sized a buffer wrongly and retrying would hide it.
 *
 * Strictly additive by construction, and verified so: all 17,182 previously-valid rules produce byte-identical output before and after, and the byte engine is untouched. Catalog validity under -u goes 17,182 -> 17,320, matching the byte engine exactly. Quoted operands still parse as strings ($"123" -> pass123, s"a" "XY" -> pXYss, doubled quote still one literal), and unterminated rules with trailing text are still refused, because their remainder is not valid rule syntax under either reading.
 *
 * End to end: discovering rules for targets pass" and "hello found nothing before and now finds $", ^" and i0", each confirmed by the audit trail.
 *
 * Revision 1.8  2026/09/05 01:40:43  dlr
 * Make .N deterministic at the last position. It copies the NEXT codepoint over position N, and at the last position there is no next one. ruleproc.c reads its NUL terminator there and writes a NUL, which is an artefact of a NUL-terminated buffer rather than a decision. Mirroring it read one past the live length of a buffer that is static and REUSED, so the answer depended on the candidate processed before: the same word gave 1234567Z after one word and 1234567Q after another. Output that depends on processing order is not usable, and this is the buffer-reuse class that gets fixed here rather than replayed. The character is now left alone at the last position. Found by the documentation pass while checking corner cases, not by the gates -- none of them varied the preceding candidate.
 *
 * Revision 1.7  2026/09/05 01:14:39  dlr
 * Make f cluster-aware, which r already was. Reflect appended a codepoint-reversed copy, so it put an Arabic fatha on the wrong letter, detached a Hebrew word from its points, began the copy with a bare skin-tone modifier, and turned the US flag into SU -- a DIFFERENT flag rather than a mangled one. Same two-pass shape as the reversal. Checked z, Z, y, Y and q at the same time on multi-codepoint clusters: those were already correct and are now recorded as such. Control-B, the base64 rule, stays unimplemented here and a rule using it is refused: it is absent from rule_ops.h so it was never part of the verb contract, it appears zero times in 111,000 real rules, and it is undocumented.
 *
 * Revision 1.6  2026/09/05 01:10:04  dlr
 * Finish the quoted-operand sweep: v, 3 and e now take a string too. vNS inserts a string after every N clusters, 3NS toggles after the Nth occurrence of a string separator, and eS title-cases on one. A one-character separator and a string separator are genuinely different rules, which the corpus now records: 31 with a hyphen and 31 with a double hyphen pick different letters in the same word. Every verb in the engine that takes a literal operand now accepts a quoted string; the only raw literal left is the chained prepend, where each operand is one character by construction.
 *
 * Revision 1.5  2026/09/05 00:48:01  dlr
 * Quoted operands: an operand may be a STRING, not a single codepoint. Written as $"123" or s"abc" "XY", which makes two things possible that were not. An operand can now be something with no single-codepoint spelling at all -- a Devanagari conjunct, a Yoruba vowel carrying two marks, a joiner sequence -- where before such a rule could not be written and was refused. And an operand can be longer than one character, so a suffix is one op rather than a chain, and substitution and purge work on strings of differing length. A doubled quote inside is one literal. Between two quoted operands a separator is allowed and skipped; it is NOT skipped after an unquoted one, because a space is a perfectly good operand and four rules in the first thousand of a real file substitute something for one. Divergence from the byte engine is confined to rules using a literal double quote: 7 in 10,000, of which 5 are refused loudly as unterminated rather than reparsed. That is deliberate and in keeping with a mode that already differs on shifts, on what a position counts, and on uppercasing an eszett.
 *
 * Revision 1.4  2026/09/05 00:08:03  dlr
 * Treat Khmer coeng as a conjunct linker. A frequency-ordered audit of the 43 most-spoken languages, 26 scripts, found reversing Khmer left a trailing coeng: U+17D2 is defined as combining with the consonant that FOLLOWS to form a subscript, so it cannot end a word. Tamil was flagged by the same check and is correct as it stands: its pulli is always visible and a consonant carrying one is a normal standalone letter, which is why Unicode excludes Tamil from Indic_Conjunct_Break. The audit is otherwise clean across all 43: no stranded marks, no divergence between the two normal forms, no disagreement with the independent model.
 *
 * Revision 1.3  2026/09/05 00:03:01  dlr
 * Cluster layer: a rule now moves and removes whole grapheme clusters, not codepoints. Every position and length operand counts clusters, so a rule that says delete character three means the third thing a reader sees. Combining marks travel with their base, which fixes Arabic harakat, Hebrew niqqud, Thai vowel signs and NFD Latin: reversing meem-fatha-reh by codepoint put the fatha on the reh, and dropping the leading codepoint left a mark with no base, which is malformed text rather than a shorter word. Emoji join too: a joiner sequence, a regional-indicator pair and a skin-tone modifier are each one cluster. Korean conjoining jamo form one syllable per UAX 29 GB6 through GB8, which matters because macOS stores filenames decomposed. Devanagari consonant plus virama plus consonant is one conjunct per GB9c, so a drop no longer leaves a dangling halant, and the non-joiner extends rather than starting a word of its own. Halfwidth katakana sound marks are filed as modifier LETTERS but are Extend in UAX 29, so they needed naming. Reversal is two in-place passes and no scratch buffer. Validated against an independent model: 116 rules over 208 words across ten scripts, zero disagreements, and the ASCII gate is unchanged.
 *
 * Revision 1.2  2026/09/04 23:04:01  dlr
 * Complete the verb set at all 61, and widen the case layer well past Latin. The last seven verbs are S, hash-exit, hex upper and lower, div-insert, toggle-at-separator and the two whitespace no-ops, each derived from ruleproc.c rather than inferred. Hex is the one verb where both engines agree for ALL input, not just ASCII: the byte engine hexes raw bytes and the input is UTF-8, so hexing the UTF-8 serialisation reproduces it exactly. Fixed the capitalise verbs, which had been written to hashcat semantics by inference: ruleproc.c capitalises the first ALPHABETIC codepoint, skipping leading digits, so 4aD4aD4a gives 4Ad4ad4a and not 4ad4ad4a. Collapsed runs of append and prepend into single ops, mirroring the byte engine: uncollapsed prepends are quadratic because each shifts the whole buffer, and 24 of them ran 9.1 times the byte engine before and 3.1 after. Case coverage goes from 3 script blocks to 23, dispatched by binary search, plus a 102-entry table for mappings whose uppercase GROWS: the twelve ligatures, the eszett and 84 Greek Extended forms a 1:1 table cannot hold. Greek carries a positional final sigma. All 3232 table entries and all 102 expansions verified against an independent source.
