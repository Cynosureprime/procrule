 * Initial revision
 *
 *
 * rule_ops.h -- the packed-rule opcode set, shared by both rule engines.
 *
 * Extracted verbatim from ruleproc.c so that ruleproc.c (bytes) and
 * ruleproc32.c (codepoints) cannot drift apart. Two copies of a 61-entry verb
 * table WILL diverge, and a divergence here is silent: a rule compiles under one
 * engine and means something else under the other. This session has twice paid
 * for exactly that shape of drift elsewhere in the tree.
 *
 * Values are unchanged and must stay unchanged: they are written into the
 * packed rule stream.
 *
 * NOTE the operand width differs between the engines even though the opcodes do
 * not. The byte engine stores an operand as one byte; the UTF-32 engine stores a
 * codepoint, which does not fit in one. The opcode VALUES are shared; the packed
 * stream layouts are not interchangeable.
